While at Railsconf 2015 I was fortunate to have the opportunity to co-present on [Trailblazer](http://trailblazer.to/), a new way to structure Ruby on Rails applications, with its creator, [Nick Sutterer](https://twitter.com/apotonick).

Nick is a great guy, and a lot of fun to work with. For some reason he and I get along famously well, and Engine Yard asked us to co-present that year. In this presentation, Nick explains the "why" of Trailblazer, and I show the audience an application built with Nick's framework.

I encourage you to watch the full presentation as it's interesting and Nick is a great presenter, but my demo starts at about 24:30 in.
