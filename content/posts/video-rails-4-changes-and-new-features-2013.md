Ruby on Rails version 4 released, by total luck, the very same day I gave this presentation at "Austin on Rails", a local Ruby on Rails meetup in Austin, TX. This presentation covers tons of changes and features between versions 3 and 4 of the popular web application framework.

This presentation is also accompanied by a two-part series I wrote for Engine Yard; it seems that their migration to a new blog platform has mangled the formatting, but the information is nonetheless available at the Engine Yard blog as well as PDF documents I've made from said blog in the event Engine Yard no longer hosts the content.
